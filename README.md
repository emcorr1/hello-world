# hello-world
## My first repository
This is my first repository on GitHub. I am not new to coding, but I am very new to this!
## Why I'm Here
I am using GitHub to help keep track of my projects and packages for aiding with basic data analysis, for keeping track of lab improvement projects, as well as for code development for volleyball-specific sports and performance analysis.
